		Snappers are one of the more unique creatures of Merra mostly in the way they propagate, almost no snappers possess male genitalia (besides the rare Cock-Snapper) so how do they reproduce? Within every snappers breast, a set of testicles reside and their heads work as the exit point for the sperm. Snappers use their sperm as a projectile to transform potential mates or new additions to their group.
