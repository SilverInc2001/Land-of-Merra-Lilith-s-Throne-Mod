		Skirrans are a merran race of small rodent-like creatures. Before the big cities were build,
most Skirrans lived in small tribes inside the merran forests.
Skirrans are incredible curious creatures. They are also very credulous and easy to scare,
since most races are bigger than them.

		A natural Skirran Transformation is very rare, since it can only be triggered in Full-moon light,
and a special kind of fruit is needed. Nowadays, the Inquisition (in Merra) uses a synthetic gas in
different conentrations, to time the duration of the punishment.

                Since Skirrans are often too small, clumsy or curious to do regular work inside cities, most people in the town are happy if they at least do nothing stupid. Some Skirrans work as helpers in houses or pubs though.
