# Land-of-Merra-Lilith's-Throne-Mod-
This mod I created is for a game called Lilith's throne and is based on the writing and artwork of an artist called Lunate (https://www.furaffinity.net/user/lunate/). It contains various species and items of Merra. Though all the visuals and writing are made by me, I'd like to say I am not stealing any ideas from Lunate. I'm just basing a Mod on her world and as such, I will never claim any of the intellectual property is my own.   
If you want to contrubte to the mod I'm compleatly fine with it, just make sure you test your additions befor adding it.
